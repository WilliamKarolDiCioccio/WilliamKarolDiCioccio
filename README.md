Hi there! I'm a young programming enthusiast who loves exploring different programming aspects. I'm particularly skilled in C++ and Dart but always eager to learn and expand my knowledge.

Currently, my studies are focused on the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks for computer vision. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in this field.

In addition to programming, I enjoy spending my free time outdoors and exploring nature. Nature provides a peaceful and serene environment that can help us think creatively and improve our overall well-being.

OpenLocalUI is the last project I began working on. It's a Flutter desktop app providing a user interface to interact with an Ollama client. I started working on it as I'm a huge fan of running LLMs locally for privacy and customization and other existing software doesn't satisfy me. It is accessible and has a lot of potential so I suggest you take a look at it!

One of my most important projects is Rake, a game engine, or at least a good starting point for one. It's a project I'm proud of as it is the best display of my technical knowledge. I hope you'll enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed working on it. Furthermore, I'm searching for collaborators to help me realize my view of Rake.
