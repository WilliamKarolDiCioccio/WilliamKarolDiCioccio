Hi there! I'm a young programming enthusiast who loves exploring different programming aspects. I'm particularly skilled in C++ and Dart but always eager to learn and expand my knowledge.

Currently, my studies are focused on the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks for computer vision. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in this field.

In addition to programming, I enjoy spending my free time outdoors and exploring nature. Nature provides a peaceful and serene environment that can help us think creatively and improve our overall well-being.

OpenLocalUI is the last project I began working on. It's a Flutter desktop app providing a user interface to interact with an Ollama client. I started working on it as I'm a huge fan of running LLMs locally for privacy and customization and other existing software doesn't satisfy me. It is accessible and has a lot of potential so I suggest you take a look at it!

This is the most appreciated repository on my profile‚Äîa Flutter package for building node-based UIs, particularly node editors. However, its flexibility allows for a wide range of applications. I'm especially proud of this project as it showcases my contribution to the Flutter ecosystem and highlights my active engagement in the Flutter developers community.
