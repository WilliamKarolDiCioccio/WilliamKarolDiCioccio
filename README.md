### Hi there! üëã

I'm an 18-year-old developer passionate about IT. My goal is not to build a billion-dollar startup or work for big tech but simply to create open-source projects that help others achieve their goals. My aim is to find a sustainable way to support myself while dedicating as much time as possible to open-source development.

As a developer, I focus on enabling great user experiences and empowering others to bring their ideas to life. But beyond code, what truly matters to me is leaving a lasting impact on the people I interact with, through shared appreciation, collaboration, and meaningful connections. Sometimes, we get so caught up in chasing big ambitions that we forget what truly makes us happy: the relationships we build along the way, even in virtual spaces.

I believe that greatness cannot be planned, a philosophy I deeply resonate with (and the title of a book I love). Though I‚Äôve been programming since I was 13, I don‚Äôt see myself as just a "tech person." If my work leaves more of a sociocultural mark than a purely technical one, I‚Äôd consider that a true success.

Mosaic is my biggest and most ambitious project so far: a modern, cross-platform game engine written in C++20. It targets **Windows, Linux, Android, and Web** through **Vulkan** and **WebGPU**, and is built with performance and modularity in mind. I hope one day this will become a professional-grade software and represent the foundation for a game development studio.

This is the most appreciated repository on my profile, a Flutter package for building node-based UIs, particularly node editors. However, its flexibility allows for a wide range of applications. I'm especially proud of this project as it showcases my contribution to the Flutter ecosystem and highlights my active engagement in the Flutter developers community.

OpenLocalUI it's a Flutter desktop app providing a user interface to interact with an Ollama client. I started working on it as I'm a huge fan of running LLMs locally for privacy and customization and other existing software doesn't satisfy me. It is accessible and has a lot of potential so I suggest you take a look at it!

### üìñ I Just Published My First Article!

This is my first time writing about one of my projects, and I went all in. The article dives deep into how FlNodes works, from GPU batching and spatial hashing to layout, interactivity, and Flutter‚Äôs rendering internals.
If you‚Äôre curious about the architecture behind the library, or just like reading about creative engineering in Flutter, you can check out the article on the platform of your preference:
