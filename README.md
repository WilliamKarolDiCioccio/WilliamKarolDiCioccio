Currently, my studies are focused on the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks for computer vision. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in this field.

One of my most important projects is Rake, a game engine, or at least a good starting point for one. It's a project I'm proud of and I hope you'll enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed working on it. Furthermore, I'm searching for collaborators to help me make my view of Rake come true.

In addition to programming, I enjoy spending my free time outdoors and exploring nature. Nature provides us with a peaceful and serene environment that can help us to think creatively and improve our overall well-being.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always happy to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for programming and learning.
