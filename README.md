### Hi there! 👋

I'm an 18-year-old developer passionate about IT. My goal is not to build a billion-dollar startup or work for big tech but simply to create open-source projects that help others achieve their goals. My aim is to find a sustainable way to support myself while dedicating as much time as possible to open-source development.

As a developer, I focus on enabling great user experiences and empowering others to bring their ideas to life. But beyond code, what truly matters to me is leaving a lasting impact on the people I interact with—through shared appreciation, collaboration, and meaningful connections. Sometimes, we get so caught up in chasing big ambitions that we forget what truly makes us happy: the relationships we build along the way, even in virtual spaces.

I believe that greatness cannot be planned—a philosophy I deeply resonate with (and the title of a book I love). Though I’ve been programming since I was 13, I don’t see myself as just a "tech person." If my work leaves more of a sociocultural mark than a purely technical one, I’d consider that a true success.

OpenLocalUI is the last project I began working on. It's a Flutter desktop app providing a user interface to interact with an Ollama client. I started working on it as I'm a huge fan of running LLMs locally for privacy and customization and other existing software doesn't satisfy me. It is accessible and has a lot of potential so I suggest you take a look at it!

This is the most appreciated repository on my profile—a Flutter package for building node-based UIs, particularly node editors. However, its flexibility allows for a wide range of applications. I'm especially proud of this project as it showcases my contribution to the Flutter ecosystem and highlights my active engagement in the Flutter developers community.
